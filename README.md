# Wifi Password Cracking Tool
WPA-PSK is WiFi Protected Access with a Pre-Shared Key (PSK). The weakness of this system is these exchanges, known as a 4-steps handshake. The encrypted password is shared at this time so we totally can do a dictionary attack.
The goal of this project is using "brute-force" method to create a tool can find WiFi password based on analyzing packets of the connection.
